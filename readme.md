## Make sure you start by reading the [tweet](twitter.com/minimumssstudio).

There are roughly two parts to the entire story:

- Setting up your computer to be able to develop, run and distribute electronJS projects
- Downloading the electronJS starter project in this repository and have it point at your nocode app

### First of all, requirements

- An hour of your time
- A Macbook with a recent version of macOS (preferably 10.15.5 catalina)
- Basic terminal command knowledge
  -  If you don't know how to navigate folders within your terminal, read [this](https://scotch.io/bar-talk/10-need-to-know-mac-terminal-commands)

### Stuff we'll need to install

- NodeJS
- Git

NodeJS is a piece of software that lets any computer or server run Javascript outside of a browser.

Git is a tool that makes it really easy for your computer to download pieces of code from github and other places.

### Installing NodeJS

Before installing NodeJS, let's make sure we don't already have it installed by accident (sometimes it comes with other software)

- Open up your terminal by looking for `Terminal.app` in spotlight
- Inside of the terminal, type `node -v`
- If it shows something like `12.18.4` or similar, this means you have a version of node already installed
- In that case, make sure the version is *higher* than `10.17.0`

If that command doesn't return a version and instead says something like `command not found`, we need to install NodeJS.

By far the easiest way of installing Node is going to the official NodeJS website, and downloading the installer.

Go to https://nodejs.org/en/download/ and download the latest macOS installer.

**After this, make sure to completely QUIT your terminal** (cmd + q) and open it up again to make sure it reloads your system settings.
Now, when you type `node -v` you should see something like `12.18.4`, which is the latest version as of 17 sept 2020.

### Installing Git

Next up is installing git, we also need the terminal for this.

- First try typing `git --version` to see if it's already installed
- If it is, you should see something like `git version 2.20.1...`
- If not, your macbook will automatically prompt you to install the `apple developer tools`
- Git is a part of this set of developer tools, so go ahead and accept the prompt.

### Download this electronJS project

With these things installed, we should now be able to run electron project we prepared for you guys.

First, pick a place where on your computer where you want to keep the project folder.

We usually have a `~/Development` folder with all of the projects.

- Go to that folder within your terminal
- To download the project, run this command: `git clone https://github.com/kayamy/nocode-mac-app.git`
- You should now have a new folder called `nocode-mac-app`

### Almost there!

With all of this in place, go inside of the `nocode-mac-app` folder.

You can now run `npm` commands, the `npm` command comes with NodeJS, which we installed earlier.

- First, install all the project-specfic dependencies with `npm install`
- Then launch the project with `npm start`

This should launch the starter project, and look like this

You're all set up nowüï¥Ô∏è

Next up is changing some parts of the code to point to your nocode app.

### Hooking it up to your nocode app

- Once again, go to the `nocode-mac-app` folder in finder.
- Inside of this folder you will find another folder called `src`. This holds all of the code for the starter project.
- Open up `index.js` in your favorite text editor, even `TextEdit` will work, but we prefer [visual studio code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
- Scroll down until you see a line of that looks like this `window.loadURL("https:/bubble.io");`
- Replace the url within the quotation marks with the url to your nocode app
 - For example, with bubble: `window.loadURL("https://minimum-mac-app.bubbleapps.io/version-test");`
- Don't forget to play around with the layout / sizing of your nocode app to make it fit the window
- Go back to your terminal where you ran the `npm start` command and stop the process by pressing `ctrl + c` in the terminal.
- Go ahead and run `npm start` again, you will have to do this every time you change the code.
 
### General thoughts

We highly encourage you to play around with this starter project and ask us questions on Twitter @minimumsstudio or @yelkhayami.
The code is very minimal, so please feel free to try out things and change stuff like the electronjs window size etc. It's a great opportunity to learn about code without having to write it. If you are interested in finding out how to **actually** distribute a nocode mac app let us know, so we can expand the guide and add more instructions!
